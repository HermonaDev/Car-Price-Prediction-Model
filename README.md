# Car Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for car price detection. The model utilizes various machine learning techniques to accurately predict the price of a car based on its features.

## Features

- Input: Various features such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more.
- Output: Predicted price of the car.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of car listings, including information on car specifications and corresponding prices. The dataset is carefully curated and preprocessed to ensure accurate training and evaluation.

## Machine Learning Techniques

The following machine learning techniques are employed in the model:

- Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from the dataset and transforming them into a suitable format for training.
- Regression Algorithms: Utilizing advanced regression algorithms, such as linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression, to predict car prices.
- Model Evaluation: Employing various evaluation metrics, including mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared, to assess the performance and accuracy of the model.

## Usage

To use the car price detection model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction-model.git`
